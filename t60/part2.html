            	<h2>And Test, Test, and Test Some More</h2>
            	<p>I tested Timed linux Kernel Compilation, to get something I could use to compare the system pre-upgrade and post-upgrade.</p>
            	<p>I wanted to test HPL as well (so I could compare to the Top500 list), but I couldn't get it running on the 32 bit system.</p>
            	<p>Pre-upgrade, the laptop has an Intel Core 2 Duo T2400 CPU, and 3 GB of RAM (1+2 configuration).</p>
            	<p>These tests were done running a live boot of Linux Mint LMDE 6, 32 bit for the pre-upgrade, 32 bit and 64 bit for the post upgrade. Tests were done using Linux 6.18.6, using make -j2, and the default .config output from make nconfig. The source files were stored on the same USB drive for all tests.</p>
